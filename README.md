# Path_Planning
A* algorith for an agent to find its way to eat the apples in a maze. Apples represent the stations to stop. Task is the stop at the stations while finding the shortest way. 

Heuristic function i used for this task =

**furtherest station (apple) distance from current situation** + 
**distance of furherest station from the furtherest station**


### Issues and TODO

- Is not that efficient, takes long to compute, needs rewrite (this is a pretty old project of mine)
- Need better visiulizing with animations
- Node class need more features to keep the algorithm more simple
- Well i can't imageine a better heuristic than this lol
